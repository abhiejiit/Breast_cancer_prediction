# Breast_cancer_prediction

This is an exploratory project in the filed of Classification and regression modelling under the domain Machine Learning.
Here, we consider the last colum as our Dependent Variable(Y) which we are interested in finding. It holds inary values corresponding to a Yes/NO situation.
We have multiple attributes as our features of matix (X) which is our independent variable. We train the model on these features to obtain the value of an unknown Y.

Since this is a sensitive problem, the model which we are training must be highly accurate and must not be misleading. Keeping this intention in our mind, we carefully trained the machine to work under various famous machine learning classification models like the SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random forest and decision trees and validated its r^2 score and the accuracy score. we picked the model that performed the best, thus making minimal errors in the breast cancer prediction.
